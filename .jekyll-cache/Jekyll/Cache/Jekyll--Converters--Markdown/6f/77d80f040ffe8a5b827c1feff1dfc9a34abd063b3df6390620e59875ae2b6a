I"k<p>This week I had a phone interview with a recruiter; it was a double first for me. My first time doing a phone interview and my first time speaking with a recruiter. We talked for a while and discussed the jobs she was looking to fill, and then halfway through our conversation I realized that I was having an interview while wearing sweats and a tank top.</p>
