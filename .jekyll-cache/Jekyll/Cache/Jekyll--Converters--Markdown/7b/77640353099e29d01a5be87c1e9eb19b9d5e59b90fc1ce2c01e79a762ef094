I"<p>I always wanted to start a blog, I love to write and have very little opportunity to do so after high school since I had tested out of my college english courses (yes, I was one of those weird people in class who actually liked writing essays!). But I didn't know how to find a good blogging site and start a blog and so I just kept putting it off. And then I started building my website and could just add my own blogging page. And suddenly I was faced with my largest obstacle yet. What was I going to blog about?</p>
