I"˜<p>This week I had a phone interview with a recruiter; it was a double first for me. My first time doing a phone interview and my first time speaking with a recruiter. We talked for a while and discussed the jobs she was looking to fill, and then halfway through our conversation I realized that I was having an interview while wearing sweats and a tank top.</p>

<p>And she had no idea.</p>

<p>I was being professional, despite the fact that I was not dressed in proper Interview Attire. Now, I'm not saying wearing sweats to an in-person interview is acceptable (personally, I don't think wearing sweats in public is acceptable unless you are going on an emergency trip to Meijer for something important, like ice cream). I wouldn't take someone wearing sweats seriously if I was an interviewer (or in any aspect of life). But this incident reminded me of a topic that's always annoyed me; why are we told that we have to wear black and white clothing to an interview?</p>

<p>I remember my first real interview last year for an internship position at a small company. The occasion was memorable because it turned out to be one of those moments when you stop and question something that Just Is and end up stuck wondering, ‚Äúok, but why.‚Äù Standing in front of my closet several days prior, I had stared at a row of purple, red, and blue clothes, interspersed with a couple of greens and yellows, and the rare white or black and wondered what on earth I was going to wear.</p>

<p>After some research online, I found that most sites recommended no just business formal or casual, but black and white business attire. Even if the dress code for the actual company was more relaxed, it seemed to be a rule that formal (colorless) business clothes must be worn to an interview. And as I came to understand it, Interview Attire meant clothing devoid of color, possessing minimal flare and exhibiting minimal individuality. No purple or blue shirts no matter how dressy they were. No summer skirts or dresses.</p>

<p>Conjuring up images of every movie I had seen featuring Real Businesswoman, I then dug into the back of my closet for a skirt my sister had given me a while back. I paired it with a cr√®me colored shirt that I was also relatively certain was not mine, and a dressy black sweater. I eschewed my summer dress sandals and boots for a pair of plain black flats and set the outfit on my bed for inspection.</p>

<p>Black sweater, cr√®me shirt, black and cr√®me skirt with, oh? Was that a touch of actual color in the skirt? It was! A few small red-colored shapes were mixed in with the others in a geometric design. Besides those barely perceivable bits of red, the outfit was completely devoid of color.</p>

<p>All our lives we have been encouraged to show our individuality. I have lost track of how many times I had to answer the question of What Makes You Unique? Be unique. Have qualities that make you stand out from the rest. Don‚Äôt go with the flow! Don‚Äôt try to be someone you‚Äôre not just to Fit In. Or the best one: Stay True to Yourself!</p>

<p>Oh but not too true to yourself. Don‚Äôt have multiple piercings, don‚Äôt have noticeable tattoos. Don‚Äôt show too much personal expression. Because that just wouldn‚Äôt be Professional.</p>

<p>What makes someone a Professional? Here is what I would look like if I starred in a black and white movie!</p>

<p>What makes someone a good potential employee? Here is my work experience! It proves that... I just graduated college and have no experience in my field.</p>

<p>This doesn‚Äôt seem quite right.</p>

<p>Here is my work history. I can work well with others, as either a leader or a follower. I have missed maybe two days of work in the last four years, and am rarely ever late. Here are some examples of projects I am currently working on. Here are my credentials. These are proof that I can learn and grow. Here is what makes me unique.</p>

<p>This is who I am. This is why you should hire me.</p>

<p>I still wore the black and cr√®me outfit to that first interview. But I wore sweats during my most recent phone-interview, and we still had a serious, Professional conversation. And next time, next time I have an in-person interview, maybe I'll be more prepared. I‚Äôll go shopping and find the perfect outfit. An outfit that will allow me to express myself without looking Unprofessional.</p>

<p>Yes, I am taking this seriously. Yes, I understand that in the business world professionalism is very important to a company's image. But I am not an actress in a black and white movie.</p>

<p>I have color.</p>
