      <h4>Professor Carrie Bredow</h4>
      <p>Stage: Development</p>
      </br>
      <p>Currently I am building a website for Dr. Carrie Bredow, Professor of Psychology at Hope College. This project
      is still in the early stages of development, and I am coordinating with the client on creating the content for
      the website.</p>
    </br>
      <p>The finished product will be a mobile friendly, easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and informatvie site.
        The website will include pages where users can view Dr. Bredow's research, projects, bio, and contact information.</p>

      <h4>Pine Lake Association</h4>
      <p>Stage: Design Mockup</p>
      </br>
      <p>The Pine Lake Association requested a website that they can maintain on their own, and still be able to
      share current news, post pictures, and keep an updated event calendar. My proposed solution is to set up a twitter
      page for use as the association's news updates, a flickr account for the gallery, and a gmail account including
      a google calendar. Currently, my design mockup displays examples of what these features would look like, untill
      I can meet with the clients again to set up and explain the necessary accounts.</p>
    </br>
      <p>In addition to the above features, the site will also include pages with information regarding the history and statistics
      of the lake and lake association, treatment schedules, courtesy rules, and contacts.
