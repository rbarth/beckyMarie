title:  "The Interview: Coming Soon In Color!"
excerpt:
---
<br>
<p>This week I had a phone interview with a recruiter; it was a double first for me. My first time doing a phone interview and my first time speaking with a recruiter. We talked for a while and discussed the jobs she was looking to fill, and then halfway through our conversation I realized that I was having an interview while wearing sweats and a tank top.</p>
<br>
<p>And she had no idea.</p>
<br>
<p>I was being professional, despite the fact that I was not dressed in proper Business Attire. Now, I'm not saying wearing sweats to an in-person interview is acceptable (personally, I don't think wearing sweats in public is acceptable unless you are going on an emergency trip to Meijer’s for something important, like ice cream). I wouldn't take someone wearing sweats seriously if I was an interviewer. But this incident reminded me of a topic that's always annoyed me. Why do we have to wear black and white clothing to an interview?</p>
<br>
<p>I remember my first real interview last year for an internship position at a small company. The occasion was memorable because it turned out to be one of those moments when you stop and question something that Just Is and end up stuck going, “ok, but why.” Standing in front of my closet several days prior, I had stared at a row of purple, pink, and blue clothes, interspersed with a couple of greens and reds and yellows, and the rare white or black and wondered what on earth I was going to wear.</p>
<br>
<p>My concept of interview appropriate clothing was Business Attire. Even if the dress code for the actual company was more relaxed, it seemed to be a rule that Business Attire must be worn to an interview. And as I understood it, Business Attire meant clothing devoid of color, possessing minimal flare and exhibiting minimal individuality. No purple or blue shirts no matter how dressy they were. No summer skirts or dresses.</p>
<br>
<p>Conjuring up images of every movie I had seen featuring Real Businesswoman, I then dug into the back of my closet for a skirt my sister had given me a while back. I paired it with a crème colored shirt that I was also relatively certain was not mine, and a dressy black sweater. I eschewed my dainty summer sandals and fashionable boots for a pair of plain black flats and set the outfit on my bed for inspection.</p>
<br>
<p>Black sweater, crème shirt, black and crème skirt with, oh? Was that a touch of actual color in the skirt? It was! A few small red-colored shapes were mixed in with the others. Besides those barely perceivable bits of red, the outfit was completely devoid of color.</p>
<br>
<p>If ever I had harbored dreams of wanting to work for a major corporation, I think that outfit would have squashed them.</p>
<br>
<p>All our lives we have been encouraged to show our individuality. I have lost track of how many times I had to answer the question of What Makes You Unique? Be unique. Have qualities that make you stand out from the rest. Don’t go with the flow! Don’t try to be someone you’re not just to Fit In. Or the best one: Stay True to Yourself!</p>
<br>
<p>Oh but not too true to yourself. Don’t have multiple piercings, don’t have noticeable tattoos. Don’t show too much personal expression. Because that just wouldn’t be Professional.</p>
<br>
<p>What makes someone a Professional? Here is what I would look like if I starred in a black and white movie!</p>
<br>
<p>What makes someone a good potential employee? Here is my work experience! It proves that... I just graduated college and have no experience in my field.</p>
<br>
<p>This doesn’t seem quite right.</p>
<br>
<p>Here is my work history. I can work well with others, as either a leader or a follower. I almost never miss work, nor am I ever late. Here are some examples of projects I am currently working on. Here are my credentials. These are proof that I can learn and grow. Here is what makes me unique.</p>
<br>
<p>This is who I am. This is why you should hire me.</p>
<br>
<p>I still wore the black and crème outfit to that first interview. But I wore sweats during my most recent interview, and we still had a serious, Professional conversation. And next time, next time I have an in-person interview, maybe I'll be more prepared. I’ll go shopping and find the perfect outfit. An outfit that will allow me to express myself without looking Unprofessional.</p>
<br>
<p>Yes, I am taking this seriously. Yes, I understand that this is the Real World. But I am not an actress in a black and white movie.</p>
<br>
<p>I have color.</p>
