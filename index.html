            <h4>Hobbies & Interests</h4>
            <p>When not working on marketing pieces or improving my skills, I am an avid reader, amateur novelist, videogame enthusiast, and chocolate aficionado. I also enjoy cooking, baking, drinking coffee that tastes like chocolate, and trying to convince myself to go running.</p>
            <p>I recently adopted my dog Loki, a 10lb year old shihtzu poodle mix with a big personality, and have been working on training him in basic commands and tricks.</p>

          <h4>History</h4>
          <p>Born and raised in Grand Rapids, I graduated from Davenport University with a bachelor's degree in web design and development. I then decided to combine my web degree with my love of writing and pursued a career in digital marketing.</p>
          <p>I moved to Holland for work and fell in love with the lakeshore. My dog and I enjoy taking walks on the beach where I ponder life, work, and the pursuit of happiness while he eats sand and warns me about waves and boats.</p>

        <h4>Hobbies & Interests</h4>
        <p>When not working on marketing pieces or improving my skills, I am an avid reader, amateur novelist, videogame enthusiast, and chocolate aficionado.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy cooking, baking, drinking coffee that tastes like chocolate, and trying to convince myself to go running.</p>
        <p>I recently adopted my dog Loki, a 10lb year old shihtzu poodle mix with a big personality, and have been working on training him in basic commands and tricks.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Born and raised in Grand Rapids, I graduated from Davenport University with a bachelor's degree in web design and development. I then decided to combine my web degree with my love of writing and pursued a career in digital marketing.</p>
        <p>I moved to Holland for work and fell in love with the lakeshore. My dog and I enjoy taking walks on the beach where I ponder life, work, and the pursuit of happiness while he eats sand and warns me about waves and boats.</p>
