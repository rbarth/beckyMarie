  <h2>Web Design & Development</h2>
</div>

<div id="home2">
  <p id="intro">I am a junior web designer/writer born and raised in the Grand Rapids area.
    I am finishing up my degree in Web Design and Development at Davenport University and working on building my
    portfolio and increasing my skill set.</p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I am proficient at writing and designing, and my development skills include html5, css3, and a bit of javascript. Additionally, I am familiar with the Adobe Creative Suite programs, especially Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
        <p>I have been trained in technical, professional, and even creative writing techniques, earned recognition and the English Department award for my excellant literary aptitude, and served as an editor for the college magazine.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <br>
        <p>When not designing or developing websites, I am an avid reader, amateur novelist, and beginner violinist. I also enjoy eating new foods, seeing new places, and trying new
  activities just to say that I have (I can now say that water-skiing, snowboarding, and paint-balling are not among my talents).</p>
        <p>While my ventures into outdoor activities are typically one time deals, I plan to continue reading, writing, and playing violin for many years to come.</p>
        <p>Throughout the last few years, I have made a passing study of art, music, writing, mythology, and psychology. My love of art emerged young, and prompted me to join school art clubs and attend Blue Lake Fine Arts camp as an art major, and eventually led to my interest in web design.</p>
        <p>All my interests stem from a desire to create, using any medium available.</p>

      <div id="col3">
        <h3>History</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Originally a psychology and writing major, I decided to change tracks and embrace the technological age into which I was born.</p>
        <p>My mentor and brother-in-law Andrew Bredow introduced me to the world of web design and development, where I discovered that I could utilize my passions for art, design, and writing in addition to new skills in css and html to create websites.</p>
